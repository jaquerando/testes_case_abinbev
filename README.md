Data pipeline summary
This data pipeline ingests data from the Open Brewery DB API, performs transformations, and loads it into a data lake structured with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. It leverages Apache Airflow for orchestration, ensuring scheduled execution, error handling, and dependency management between the stages. Google Cloud Storage is used for data storage, and BigQuery serves as the final destination for analytical queries.

Medallion Architecture: Implements the Bronze, Silver, Gold layered approach for data lake organization. Incremental Loading: Only processes new or changed data, improving efficiency. Data Validation: Uses hash comparisons to ensure data integrity. Monitoring and Alerting: Includes logging to GCS and email alerts for proactive monitoring. Orchestration: Utilizes Apache Airflow for scheduling, task dependencies, and error handling.
